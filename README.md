# Seattle University CS Courses I have taken and relevant CS assignments

** Disclaimer - Course work is mainly done in C++, C#, python, and F#. Only worked w/ Jupyer Notebook/Python for one course with lots of code for the labs, therefore the repo' langauage detection is so high for Jupyter Notebook.

### Course Number - Description

### CPSC 1420 Programming and Prob Solving 1 - 
Introduction to programming and computing fundamentals, with emphasis on problem solving, design and style. Prior programming experience is not required. This course introduces fundamental programming concepts such as functional decomposition, stepwise refinement, control structures, loops, functions, primitive and aggregate data types


### CPSC 1430 Programming and Prob Solving 2 - 
Continuation of programming and problem solving, including abstract data types (ADTs), dynamic memory, linked lists, stacks, queues, and testing.


### CPSC 2430 Data Structures - 
Fundamental data structures including binary search trees, priority queues, hash tables, and heaps. Abstract data type implementation and design. Code analysis using big-O notation, recursion, and sorting algorithms.


### CPSC 2600 Foundations of Computer Science - 
Introduction to logic, applications of logic, methods of proof , sets, functions, induction, recurrence relations, graphs, and counting.


### CPSC 2500 Computer Organization - 
Basic concepts of computer organization including data representation, digital logic, processor architecture, caching, and parallel architectures. Implementation via assembly language programming.


### CPSC 3300 Fundamentals of Databases - 
Fundamental concepts of database design and applications, including relational database design, entity-relationship (ER) model, standard query language (SQL), transaction management, and triggers. Design and development of applications using databases.


### CPSC 3200 Object Oriented Development - 
Object oriented development emphasizing class design and relationships. Topics include interfaces, contracts, containment, composition, inheritance, overloading and polymorphism. Analysis of alternative design choices, software maintainability and code reuse.


### CPSC 3500 Computing Systems - 
Computer system infrastructure, implementation, and design. Topics include operating systems, resource allocation and scheduling, concurrency, synchronization, virtualization, reliability, networking, and security. Development of multithreaded concurrent programs and client-server networking programs.


### CPSC 3400 Languages and Computation - 
Common features, organization and tradeoffs of modern programming languages including types, binding, and memory management. Theoretical foundations of languages and computation including regular expressions, language classification, grammars, and finite state automata. Functional style programming including higher-order functions and closures.


### CPSC 4100 Design & Analysis of Algorithm -
Design of algorithms using divide and conquer, greedy methods, and dynamic programming. Analysis of algorithms, parallel algorithms, and intractability.


### CPSC 4510 Computer Networks - 
The study of computer networks and the services built on top of them. Topics include packet-switch and multi-access networks, reliable data transfer, routing and multicasting, Internet protocols (IP, TCP, BGP), Internet architecture, the client-server model, network programming, peer-to-peer networks and security.


### MATH 2310 Probability and Statistics for Sci & Eng - 
Probability models; discrete and continuous random variables, basic concepts of descriptive and statistical inference; applications. The course will include use of computer software.
