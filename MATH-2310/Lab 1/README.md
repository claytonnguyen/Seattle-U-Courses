# Histograms

1. As we discussed in LAB 0(Introduction to R) Notes , R can create vectors of random data. Create a vector of 10 random values using rnorm and then create a histogram using this data. Label the histogram "Random Normal Data", label the x axis "Values", and use green as the color for the bars.
2. Using the same design parameters as in number 1, i.e. label, x-axis, bar color, create a histogram of 500 random values using rnorm. Then do it again using 50,000 values.
3. For each of the the three histograms, what was width of the classes that R used by default? Adjust each of these histograms so that the height of the bars is density rather than frequency and there are 50 classes in each histogram.
4. What is happening as you increase the size of the data as well as the number of bins? Does the shape being created look familiar? Describe what you think would happen to the histogram as the size of the data goes to infinity and the class width goes to 0?
