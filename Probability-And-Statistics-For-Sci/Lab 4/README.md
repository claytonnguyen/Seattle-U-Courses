# Correlation and Regression

1. Use the mosaicData package to upload the Utilities data set and calculate the correlation between gas usage and temperature.
2. Create a plot with both the scatter plot and the least squares line where x is the temperature and y is the gas usage
3. Create two residual plots (one for x and one for y) for the linear model in the previous question.
4. Use the linear model to predict the gas usage when the temperature is 47 degrees Fahrenheit.


For this project we will be looking at recent data regarding the stock prices of Gamestock(GME) and AMC (AMC) in the beginning of 2021.

1. Upload the csv, AMC_GME.csv, into your R workspace.
2. Let x be Gamestop's opening price and y be AMC's opening price. Find the correlation, regression line, and coefficient of determination. Interpret what each of the calculations tells you about the relationship between teacher salary and completion rates.
3. Make a residual plot for the linear model. Do you think that a linear model captures the full relationship? Why or why not?
4. Predict the opening rate for GME if the opening of AMC is 7 dollars.
5. Create two residual plots for a linear model of AMC vs GME open and AMC vs GME close. Do you think that the linear model captures the relationship? Why or why not?
6. Use the mutate function to create a new column in the data frame of categorical variable labeling what quartile of the AMC_Volume the observation is in. Create a single scatter plot that displays the stratified data and the regression models for each stratification. What might explain the differences in the models?
