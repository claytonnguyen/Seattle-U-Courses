# Distributions

1. Create a histogram of 1000 random values from a lognormal distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation 2
2. If x is a random variable whose distribution is normal with mean 100 and standard deviation 23, for what value of c is there a 65% that x <= c?
3. Given that a product has a 98% chance of success, what is the probability that there is at most 3 faulty products in a group of 100?
4. If x is a discrete random variable whose distribution is Poisson with ^ = 6.7, what is the likelihood that x > 8?


The website, https://www.the-numbers.com/, has lots of data regarding the success of movies. I have included two csvs that include data about the top 100 grossing movies of all time, TopMovies_thenumbers.csv. Note that these numbers have not been adjusted for inflation.

1. Upload the TopMovies_thenumbers.csv into your R workspace.
2. What are the columns of the data frame?
3. Create a new data frame that only includes the Domestic Box Office.
4. What percentage of top 100 grossing movies (domestic) were produced by Walt Disney?
5. If you randomly selected 10 of the top grossing movies of all time (domestic), what is the chance that at least 50% of them were produced by Walt Disney?
6. Rotten Tomatoes has released a list of the 89 most anticipated movies of 2021 (https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/most-anticipated-movies-of-2021/). With 95% confidence, at least how many of the 89 top movies of 2021 do you predict will be produced by Walt Disney?
