# Probability

1. Calculate the probability of 5 out of 7 items being turned "on" when the probability of being turned on is 65%.
2. Calculate the probability that X > 5 where X is a random variable distributed according to a normal distribution with u = 4 and o = 2.2
3. Calculate the probability of more than 6 events happening in a time period when the average number of events per period is 4.
4. Use mosaicData to upload CPS85 data set into your workspace and calculate the probability of a person being married  in 1985 given that they are female.


In this lab we will use the Movies.csv data set to investigate the relationship between opening profit (revenue minus budget) and being a Disney film.

1. Create a contingency table for the joint probabilities of being a Disney film and having opening profit.
2. What is the conditional probability of making a profit during opening and being a Disney film?
3. Use the chi-square test to determine whether the two variables are independent.
4. What is your interpretation of the result from the previous part?
