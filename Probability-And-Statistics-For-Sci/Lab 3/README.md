# Plots and Graphs

1. Use the mpg data set and ggplot and to create a single figure that compares histograms of the city mileages of Ford and Toyota vehicles.
2. Use the mpg data set and ggplot to create a single figure with boxplots of city mileage for all cylinder types.
3. Create random a vector of data with 1000 observations associated to log-normal distribution, use this data to create a data frame, and then make a normality plot for the resulting data.
4. Using the random data from the previous problem, create a quantile plot comparing the data to the log-normal distribution.


A yield curve is a line that plots yields (interest rates) of bonds having equal credit quality but differing maturity dates. The slope of the yield curve gives an idea of future interest rate changes and economic activity. Treasury securities are often viewed as the safest securities available and thus offer a baseline for yield rates of other bonds. You can find information about treasury yield curve rates here, https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield

1. Upload the csv, daily_treasury_yield_curve_rates.csv into your R workspace.
2. Create a scatterplot of the 1 month rates throughout 2020. Can you explain the behavior? What do you think is happening?
3. Create a single plot with boxplots comparing 10 , 20, and 30 year yield rates.
4. Find the summary of the 1 month yield rates and then clear the dataset of any outliers. Create a qq plot of the 1 month yield rates with no outliers. 
5. Find the mean and standard deviation of the 1 month yield rates with no outliers. What yield rate is greater than 95% of the other? Compare this value to the yield rates for January 2021 found on https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield
6. Use the data to construct a plot of your choosing.
